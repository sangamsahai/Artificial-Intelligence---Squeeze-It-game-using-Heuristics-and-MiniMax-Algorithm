# Artificial-Intelligence---Squeeze-It-game-using-Heuristics-and-MiniMax-Algorithm
This is the code for a Thai board game called 'Squeeze-It' . This is an interesting problem to solve for the people who love
to think about interesting Heuristics and making the computer smarter than Humans.


This game is played between 2 players . 
It is board game , in which each player has to make a 'Squeeze' pattern to eliminate the pieces of the opponent from the board.
The one who is left with more number of pieces in the end wins the game.
The complete rule-set and the description is given in the file Problem_Description.pdf.

This code takes any board configuration as an input and predicts the next best move for the player.
I have used Intelligent Heuristics to allocate score to different board configurations.
And finally , I have used the MiniMax Algorithm to traverse the search space and find the best move possible.

Also , this code is highly configurable.
You can configure your piece's color, the opponent piece's color .
Also you can configure the deapth of the tree till which , you want the code to traverse the search space.

The detailed description of the entire solution is given in the file Project_Solution_Document.pdf.

The steps to run this code are given in the file Instruction_to_run.pdf.
